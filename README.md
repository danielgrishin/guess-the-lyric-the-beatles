# guess-the-lyric-the-beatles
Guess the lyric game (The Beatles Edition) made for 2021 CUNY Hackathon. 
To win, the user was to succeed in 10 consecutive rounds of guessing the song by the given lyrics. In each round, a random song was selected from the bank of songs and depending on the difficulty the program scraped genius.com and pulled either 5,10, or 20 lines of lyrics from the given song and displayed it for the user in a text box. The user would enter the name of a song in a separate input box and check his or her answer.
This game no longer works because genius.com has since changed the way the lyrics are displayed in the songs' respective page sources.
